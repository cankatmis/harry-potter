# harry-potter
a binary search tree and linked-list project

After the tragic death of young Harry Potter’s parents, he spends his daily life with his hateful
uncle. However, his life changes in one fell swoop when a giant comes to him to tell him he is
a wizard and must continue his studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The
school has four houses competing with each other. Students are assigned to a house by the
Sorting Hat based on the young student’s qualities: the brave and reckless wizards go to
Gryffindor, the eminently clever and wise to Ravenclaw, the persistent and loyal to Hufflepuff,
and the cunning and ambitious to Slytherin.

• Create youthful wizards who are randomly assigned their qualities (Courage,
Intelligence, Perseverance, Cunning). Give them a name as well (this can be randomly
generated from a predefined first name / last name set).

• Create each house where the wizards are stored in a binary search tree. The key of the
search tree should always be the trait that that house values best (e.g., courage in the
case of Gryffindor).

• Write a program that helps the Sorting Hat assigning wizards and witches to each house
so that each house has as many wizard apprentices as possible that have the highest
value of the property corresponding to that house. Also, make sure that you get nearly
the same amount of wizards in each house.

• After the sorting procedure, the user should be able to query which wizards have some
property P with a value at least V, by listing which house each wizard belongs to.

Example:

Input:
 Courage 5
 
Output:
 Gryffindor: John Doe - Harry Potter - Ron Weasley -
 Ravenclaw: Allsaint Alice -
 Slytherin: Draco Malfoy – Bloody Bob
